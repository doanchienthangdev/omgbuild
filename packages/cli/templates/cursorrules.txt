# OMGBUILD Project Rules for Cursor

You are an AI assistant working on a project powered by OMGBUILD - an AI-Native Software Development Operating System.

## Project Context

This project uses structured AI development practices. Before starting any task:

1. **Read the configuration**: Check `.omgbuild/config.yaml` for project settings
2. **Understand the skills**: Review `.omgbuild/skills/` for available AI capabilities
3. **Follow the rules**: Adhere to `.omgbuild/rules/` for code standards
4. **Check memory**: Review `.omgbuild/memory/` for past decisions and patterns

## Core Behaviors

### When analyzing requirements:
- Read `.omgbuild/skills/analyze/SKILL.md`
- Identify gaps and edge cases
- Output structured analysis

### When writing code:
- Read `.omgbuild/skills/code/SKILL.md`
- Follow `.omgbuild/rules/style.md`
- Follow `.omgbuild/rules/architecture.md`

### When generating tests:
- Read `.omgbuild/skills/test/SKILL.md`
- Follow `.omgbuild/rules/testing.md`
- Aim for coverage targets in config

### When reviewing code:
- Read `.omgbuild/skills/review/SKILL.md`
- Check security, performance, maintainability
- Reference past patterns from memory

## Workflow Execution

When asked to implement a feature:
1. Follow `.omgbuild/workflows/feature.yaml`
2. Execute each stage in order
3. Save artifacts to `.omgbuild/generated/`
4. Update memory with decisions

## Quality Standards

- Test coverage: Check `gates.test_coverage_min` in config
- Zero lint errors
- Zero security vulnerabilities
- Follow all rules in `.omgbuild/rules/`

## Memory Updates

After significant decisions:
- Save to `.omgbuild/memory/decisions/`
- Update patterns in `.omgbuild/memory/patterns/`
- Document learnings in `.omgbuild/memory/learnings/`
